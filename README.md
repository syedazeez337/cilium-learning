# ðŸš€ Cilium Learning Repository

This repository is a hands-on guide and documentation of my journey to learn [Cilium](https://github.com/cilium/cilium) â€” an eBPF-based networking, observability, and security layer for cloud-native environments.

## ðŸ“˜ What is Cilium?

Cilium is a Kubernetes CNI plugin that uses eBPF to provide:
- High-performance networking
- Transparent security policies (L3â€“L7)
- Load balancing
- Deep observability and flow visibility using Hubble
